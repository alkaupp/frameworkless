Frameworkless app-template
==========================

The purpose of this application template is to allow building an application relying solely on single-purpose libraries.

These libraries implement various PSRs (PSR-7, PSR-17, PSR-15 to name a few) which will combine into a working application with interchangeable components.

*WIP*

Running the application
-----------------------

```
cd app
composer install --no-dev
cd ..
docker-compose up
```

Open browser in http://localhost:8080/example or /example/123456.
